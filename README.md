Project for Lexis Nexis to gather survey data for insurance underwriters. Used to better understand sales leads and generate informed inquiries into solution and sales development at Lexis Nexis.

I worked alongside legacy developers in the Lexis Nexis ecosystem to gather survey data and pass along relevant metrics via URL Parameters upon assessment completion.

Project Requirements:
- Create a survey using simple front-end languages (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP) to create an interactive assessment to help Lexis Nexis better understand insurance underwriting barriers
- Gather relevant metrics, and pass along to sales dept via URL parameters
  - Metrics should include:
    - the overall score of the assessment
    - the "level" or weight class indicated by the score (see JSON surveyData.js for more info)
    - the response to a key branching question (Q3 in surveyData.js)
- Survey should be able to be embedded within any landing page of the Lexis Nexis site
- Survey should be user friendly, and follow existing Lexis Nexis design system
